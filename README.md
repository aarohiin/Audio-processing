# Audio Processing Project

This project provides basic audio processing functionalities such as autotune, BPM change, reverb, and bass boost using Python. It uses the `pydub` library for audio manipulation and `numpy` for numerical operations.

## Features

- **Autotune**: Adjusts the pitch of the audio.
- **Change BPM**: Changes the beats per minute of the audio.
- **Reverb**: Adds a reverb effect to the audio.
- **Bass Boost**: Enhances the bass of the audio.

## Installation

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
